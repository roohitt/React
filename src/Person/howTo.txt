First is : index.js: To render or map the components we have created in this application to the index.html file's elements.
            Here we are mapping App.js's App component that we hav created using class App.

App.js: Has our main component and exporting that component as default to the index.js file.
        THere must be only one parent element inside the component function or class and we can nest other components inside it.
        Like we have used the Person component inside our App.js 
        We can pass arguments to the comppnent function Person and also some text.

Person.js : is a js file to  create a component that is called Person.
            It is called in App.js
            We can use the passed args using props.
            props.children is for text passed inside the opening and closing tag of an element.  

Object in js:
x = {name:"Rohit", Class:"10th"}(name and age are the two variables for that function).
List of Objects in js :
y = [{name:"Sharma},{name:"Rohit"}]

When we use class component state then it will automatically add all the other variables there inside state property
but when we use hooks we have to update that manually means add the rest of the components manually.
therefore in functions while using hooks try to use multiple usestate wiyhm mnultiple elements.
